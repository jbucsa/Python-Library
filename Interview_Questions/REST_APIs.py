Kicking Off Code Using URLs (REST APIs): Making Calls with requests and Processing Responses
    This statement highlights the use of Python libraries like requests to interact with web services through their REST APIs (Representational State Transfer APIs). Here's a breakdown of the steps involved and some Python code for reference:   
"""

"""
1. Importing the requests library:
"""
import requests

"""
2. Defining the API endpoint URL:
    This URL specifies the location of the API resource you want to access. It often includes base URL, path, and query parameters:
"""
api_url = "https://api.example.com/resources"  # Replace with the actual API URL

"""
3. Sending the API request:
    Use the requests library's appropriate method (e.g., get, post, put, delete) to send the request and capture the response:
"""
response = requests.get(api_url)


"""
4. Checking the response status code:
    The status code indicates the success or failure of the request:
"""
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Request successful!")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")

"""
5. Processing the response data:
    The response object contains the data returned by the API, typically in JSON format. You can use the json() method to access this data:
"""
data = response.json()

# Access specific data elements based on the API's response structure
if isinstance(data, list):
    for item in data:
        print(f"Item name: {item['name']}")  # Assuming 'name' is a key in the data
elif isinstance(data, dict):
    print(f"Data key: {data['key']}")  # Assuming 'key' is a key in the data
