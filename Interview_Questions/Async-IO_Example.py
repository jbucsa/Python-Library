""" 
Here's an example that demonstrates using asyncio for concurrent asynchronous tasks in Python, this time focusing on simulating network calls with different delays:
"""

import asyncio
import random

async def simulate_network_call(url, delay):
  """Simulates a network call with a random delay."""
  await asyncio.sleep(delay)  # Simulate waiting for the network response
  return f"Response from {url}: Delay {delay} seconds"

async def main():
  urls = ["https://url1.com", "https://url2.com", "https://url3.com"]
  delays = [random.uniform(1, 3) for _ in urls]  # Random delays between 1-3 seconds

  # Create tasks for each network call simulation
  tasks = [simulate_network_call(url, delay) for url, delay in zip(urls, delays)]

  # Run all tasks concurrently and gather their results
  results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

  # Print the results in the order they were completed (not necessarily the order of URLs)
  for result in results:
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
  asyncio.run(main())


""" 
Explanation:

    1. We import asyncio and random for asynchronous programming and generating random delays.
    2. The simulate_network_call function is an async function that takes a URL and a delay as arguments.
    3. It uses asyncio.sleep(delay) to simulate waiting for the network response with a random delay between 1 and 3 seconds.
    4. It returns a message indicating the URL and the simulated delay.
    5. The main function defines a list of URLs and generates a list of random delays for each URL.
    6. It creates a list of tasks using a comprehension, where each task calls simulate_network_call with a corresponding URL and delay.
    7. asyncio.gather(*tasks) runs all tasks concurrently, meaning they can potentially start and finish in any order based on their simulated delays.
    8. It gathers the results of all tasks in a list results.
    9. The loop iterates through the results list, printing each response. Since tasks run concurrently, the order of results may not match the order of URLs in the list.

Key Points in this Example:

    - This example showcases how asynchronous programming can handle tasks with varying execution times (simulated network delays) efficiently.
    - Tasks can initiate network calls concurrently, and the event loop manages them, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for responses.
    - The order of results might not reflect the order of tasks initiated due to the independent execution of tasks with varying delays.

Benefits of Asynchronous Programming:

    - Improved scalability for applications dealing with high volumes of I/O-bound tasks (network requests, file I/O).
    - Increased responsiveness for user interfaces as the main thread isn't blocked waiting for I/O.
    - More efficient utilization of CPU resources for I/O-bound tasks.

Remember:

    - Asynchronous programming requires a different approach to writing code compared to synchronous programming.
    - Carefully consider error handling and debugging strategies for asynchronous applications.
    - Asynchronous programming shines when dealing with many I/O-bound tasks, not necessarily for CPU-bound computations.
