# Task

Given pipeline for training a model on OHLCV candles for the NASDAQ: AMGN (Amgen, Inc.) stock. The pipeline contains various errors such as logical, mathematical, in ML and other aspects.
The objective is to find the maximum number of errors and write it down, accompanied by recommendations for their rectification.

You don’t need to write exactly how you think it’s right to write such a pipeline. It is enough to write comments to the lines in pipeline.py where you see errors, describing what they are.
